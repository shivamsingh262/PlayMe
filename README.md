My own simple chatbot that can also play movies
==========
This is a python script that opens a simple chatting application that can also play a specific movie from your system on request. Features include:
User recogniztion: Saves user's names for future reference
Chat replys are based on previous user saved inputs (need to improve on this)
Maintains a database of your movies to play on command "play movie"
